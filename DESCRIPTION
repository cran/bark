Description: Implementation of BARK: Bayesian Additive Regression
        Kernels with Feature Selection,
	<http://stat.duke.edu/people/theses/OuyangZ.html> Zhi Ouyang
	(2008), Ph.D. thesis, Chapter 3.  This package provides
	software for nonparametric function estimation using Levy
	Random Field priors for functions that may be represented as a
	sum of additive multivariate kernels.  Kernels are located at
	every data point as in SVM, however, coefficients may be
	heavily shrunk to zero under the Cauchy process priors.  The
	number of active features is controlled by priors on
	precisions within the kernels.
